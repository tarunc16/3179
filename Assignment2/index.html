            <h3> Who are the world's worst CO2 emitters?</h3>
            <p> Most of us are well aware of the threats climate change and global warming pose to our very existence. In fact scientists
                have been going on about this since the 70's. Yet the sad reality is the carbon heavy processes and technologies
                are a part of our energy mix and will remain (albeit to a much lesser extent) so for the coming decades. So which countries
                have to pull up their socks and cut their emissions the most? The map on the right shows us each country's CO2 emissions per 100,000 individuals.

            <h3>Are rich countries to blame for our climate woes?</h3>    
            <p>The short answer is yes. The graph below maps the energy intensity per capita against the GDP per capita. The size of the bubbles correspond 
                to the relative CO2 emissions per 100,000 individuals. Wealthier countries generally use more energy per individual. Correspondigly they
                also emit more emissions per individual. However, wealthier countries are also much better placed to invest in cleaner and greener
                renewable energy, and rapidly decarbonise their energy markets.<br>

            <h3>What does Australia's energy production look like?</h3>
            <p>Australia is one of the largest emitters of CO2 per capita in the world. This is largely due to the heavy reliance of
                Australian energy production on coal and natural gas. Coal is by far the dirtiest of them all, but Australia is well endowed 
                with coal reserves making it a easier and cheaper to burn it. Natural gas generally emits 50% less CO2 than coal but is still a heavy emitter
                and also very expensive. <br>
                With teh abundance of sunlight, land and wind resources, Australia has the potential to be a renewable energy superpower. 
                The reality is much more depressing however. Renewables still contribute a tiny amount to the total energy production. In recent years, renewables are
                becoming cheaper and hence more popular. <br>
                Select and drag (in the renewable line chart) the years you're interested in to focus on them!
